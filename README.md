# ERC20 emissions

This is the draft, it is an initial phase of the contract that allows users to invest funds, to later obtain a reward exchangeable for NFTs.

The contract are deployed in Mumbai, see the demo [**here**](https://bsdmv-wyaaa-aaaad-qankq-cai.ic.fleek.co/)

[**Planing**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u8cs_PrxGBKHLk9jD1hM3G9rWKKh6PRRvu39L9QyFG8/edit?ts=60e5a921#heading=h.s2ybe8291aua)  

Prestige Tiers

 - BRONCE = 0.5 USDC
 - 	SILVER = 1 USDC
 - 	GOLD = 2.5 USDC
 - 	PLATINUM = 5 USDC

## TODO ‚úÖ ‚ùå
- ‚úÖ put dummy erc20 in a subdir like test/DummyERC20 so it's clear that it is not for production.
- ‚úÖ comments on dummy erc20.
- ‚úÖ superfluous extra whitespace in dummy erc20.
- i'm not seeing hardhat or slither tests in CI.
- ‚úÖ have client side code in a separate repo so it doesn't confuse/scope creep audits.
* * [**Client**](https://github.com/nazhG/prestige-point-client) 
- ‚úÖ use solhint to check that line lengths are 80 chars.
- ‚úÖ event Claim(address indexed account, bytes data); would match rain claim.
- ‚úÖ not all @param are documented.
- ‚úÖ inmutable -> immutable.
- ‚úÖ user could achieves -> user could achieve.
- ‚úÖ 155520000 magic number should be a constant with comments.
- ‚úÖ 100000000 magic number should be a constant with comments.
- ‚úÖ 46656000 magic number should be a constant with comments.
- ‚úÖ lastClaim[account_] > userJoinBlockNumber ? lastClaim[account_] : userJoinBlockNumber can be lastClaim[account_].max(userJoinBlockNumber).
- ‚úÖ if user does not have a tier then don't they have a future block number, which would cause the block.number.sub() to error?.
* * There is no problem because a report of a user without tier is the maximum int32, this number is used in the calculation of the multiplier but since the reward is 0 for an untier person, the multiplier does not matter.

- ‚úÖ uint256[8] private tierValues is storage not immutable and so should not exist.
- ‚úÖ calculating getReward twice in claim is gas intensive.
- ‚úÖ emit the claim event after the state changes for consistency with rain.
- ‚úÖ if (userTier_ > ITier.Tier.Zero) should be a check at the top of getReward to avoid paying gas for calculating a noop.
- ‚úÖ why are the reward values each tier equal to the tier values on the transfer tier contract?.
* * The reward is 10% of the land value, it is earned after one year, for that, in the `tierRewardValues` the value divided by the number of blocks in a year and by 10,
that way, after a year, I reward her (without multiplier),
is 10% of the value of the tier.
